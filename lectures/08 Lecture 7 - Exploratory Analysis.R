# Lecture 7: Exploratory analysis
# ===============================

# 1. Introduction
# ---------------

# R allows us to plot data on a single, or multiple charts at the same time. 
# There are few techniques how we can create our plots. Bascially, R works in a 
# way that first you initalize your plot, and next you append additional 
# information to it. 

# If you are reading this file in RStudio, then when we execute a line drawing a
# a plot, it will create it in "Plots" section. So, at a time, you will have 
# only 1 canvas in which plot is drawn. Yes, you can draw few plots in one 
# canvas, and yes, you can later export them to JPG/PNG, PDF or even SVG.

# 2. Read data
# ------------

# Let's try some real example. We will try to find some insignst about people 
# who boarded on Titanic. At first let's read the data, apologies for the recap.

# Set working directory and read data to data frame.
setwd("C:/Users/Charles/Documents/git/Data-science-tutorial/data_sample")
data.titanic <- read.csv("train.csv")

# 3. Statistical summaries
# ------------------------

# We can quickly inspect the data frame by calling
View(data.titanic)

# Sometimes we will be working with big data sets, and trying to show the entire
# collection in grid view is pointless, so here's  a handy way to limit your set 
# to first N rows, and show only them on the grid. Function head takes 2 
# parameters, data frame and N. To show bottom N rows use "tail" function.
View(head(data.titanic, 10))

# Usually when we start working with some data set we want to understand its 
# structure and uncover some patterns and anomalities. 

# There are 2 ways to do it:
# - by statistically summarizing data
# - by presenting filtered data on charts

# There's no right or wrong answer here, it's a matter of personal preferences. 

# In order to get a better feel of our data set we can call "summary" function.
summary(data.titanic)
# It shows summarized information about data stored in each column, if they are
# - numbers (e.g. Age) we can see median, mean
# - caregorical (e.g. Sex) we can see how many females/males were on the ship
# Yes, some results are pointless, like mean of IDs -- R doesn't know what's ID.

# To get another glimps at our data we can call "str" function. It shows 
# structure of the data frame.
str(data.titanic)

# In order to investigate particular column we can use table function which 
# groups elements by factors. For isntance
table(data.titanic$Sex)

# We can also investigate Age of passangers. Quick glimps on the Age values:
data.titanic$Age
# AS we can see, some passangers don't have age specified (=NA). "table" 
# function will ignore them. In case of future analyses, sometimes we may want 
# to clear this data, by either injecting some values (average, default 0, 
# create prediction algorithm which will guess missing data - it does happen), 
# which then can be used for further predictions, for example.
table(data.titanic$Age)

# We might also be interested to see proportions, what fraction of passangers 
# were female. To do that we would use "prop.table" function.
prop.table(table(data.titanic$Sex))
# Notice that "prop.table" function requires data in groupped format (for 
# example summarized by "table" function).

# 4. Charting 
# -----------

# As mentioned before, the basic mechanics of charts in R are:
# - initalize chart
# - append additional information (points, fit lines, legend, etc.)

# R allows for multiple charts (I don't know all, so I'm only going to cover  
# ones I used):
# - scatterplot
# - histogram
# - barplot
# - boxplot

# 4.1. Barplot
# ------------

# Let's first do 1D charts. Say we want to see distribution of sexes on a bar 
# plot. Bar plot requires us to provide data in groupped format (for instance 
# through "table" function).
barplot(table(data.titanic$Sex))

# 4.2. Histogram
# --------------

# Let's create a very basic histogram first. NA(s) are ignored.
hist(data.titanic$Age)

# We can see that the most populus groups were people in are group 20-30 and 
# 30-40.

# If we would like to have a more  granular view. In this example, we set that x
# axis will contain 80 units.
hist(data.titanic$Age, breaks = 80)

# In order to make charts more presentable they can be fully customized, with 
# regards to labels, legends, coloring, margins... everything. I have never 
# cared about that, so you have to read about that on the Internet. It's pretty 
# straight-forward.

# 4.3. Boxplot
# ------------

# Quick re-cap what boxplot is, in case you forgot.
# http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/anatomy/box_plot.png
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot#/media/File:Boxplot_vs_PDF.svg

# In order to draw one, run this line.
boxplot(data.titanic$Age)

# 4.4. Scatterplot
# ----------------

# Say we want to see whether age of passangers had any correlation to how much 
# they payied for the cruise. To do that, we could create a chart where on X 
# axis we woud plot age, and on Y axis price of their tickets.

plot(data.titanic$Age, data.titanic$Fare)

# 4.5. Appending additional information
# -------------------------------------

# In order to demonstrate appending additional information let's say we want to 
# add a line that fits best all those points (to see trend).

# To do that we'll use "lm" function (stands for Linear Model). It creates an 
# objecvt which contains all coefficiences and other stuff (have a look).
model <- lm(data.titanic$Age ~ data.titanic$Fare)

# Next we add line to the chart by calling "abline", which takes as parameters 
# our linear model. Optionally we set line width (=lwd) to see it better.
abline(model, lwd = 2)

# 4.6. Alternative way of plotting
# --------------------------------

# As we saw in previous example when drawing a scatterplot, there was some 
# repetition. It's quite annoying, however, there's a way around this. We will 
# use "with" function, which applies a function to a data set.

with(data.titanic, plot(Age, Fare, pch = 20))
# We use "pch" argument to change how single point is draw.

# Now let's say we want to see, which of those points are "males" and which 
# are "females". To do that we re-draw points on the chart. Remember, function 
# "with" applies functin (2nd argument) to data set (1st argument). So, we have
# to restrict out data set to only passangers of one gender -- to do that we use 
# subset function. To re-draw points we use "points" function, col denotes color
# for which group.
with(subset(data.titanic, Sex == "female"), points(Age, Fare, col = "blue"))
with(subset(data.titanic, Sex == "male"), points(Age, Fare, col = "red"))

# At this point we can say that women were more willingly to pay more.

# Maybe there's a correlation between high price and chances of survival, or age
# and ticket price, etc.

# 4.7. Multiple charts
# --------------------

# Let's say we want to see 2 chars at the same time. Let's print to barplots -- 
# one for sex distribution, the other for port on which they boarded.

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
with(data.titanic, {
  barplot(table(Sex), main = "Sex Distribution")
  barplot(table(Embarked), main = "Embarkment Distribution")
})

# "par" specifies how canvas is organized. Then we plot what we want.

# 5. Exporting charts.
# --------------------

# In RStudio go to the upper ribbon of the applciation, click on "Plots" and in  
# the drop down you'll see options to save it as PDF or Image.

# Or you can use commands (it will save in working directory):

# Create PDF file and keep open stream to it.
pdf("my_chart.pdf")
# Draw plot, which will be injected into PDF.
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
with(data.titanic, {
  barplot(table(Sex), main = "Sex Distribution")
  barplot(table(Embarked), main = "Embarkment Distribution")
})
# Close stream. Otherwise Windows will "think" that RSudio is still using the 
# file.
dev.off()

# Apply the same pattern with JPGs and other formats.
jpeg("my_chart.jpg")

# 6. Scatterplot Matrices
# -----------------------

# Usually we visualize the data to see whether some variables are correlated 
# with one another. We can do it manually by creating each chart individually, 
# or we can take a shortcut and use "pairs" function.

# Say we want to learn more about iris dataset- it's a collection of 150 
# observations about some flowers, each observations contains 4 measurments.
data(iris)

# Say we would like to find out how each measure relate to all other measures 
# and whether we can find some patterns. To do that we use the following.
pairs(iris[1:4], pch = 20)

# As you can see, nothing really useful comes out of it. You can create some 
# clusters, but that's about it. 

# Luckily, we can color each species with different color. To do that we want to 
# map each observation (species from it) to a color, and store all colors in a 
# vector. So, this vector must have 150 entries.

# Initalize vercot of characters, of length equals to number of rows in out 
# data frame.
cols <- character(nrow(iris))

# At the beginning under each index we have an empty string. We have to override 
# them. We know how to do that from out previous lectures, right?
cols[iris$Species == "setosa"] <- "blue"
cols[iris$Species == "versicolor"] <- "green"
cols[iris$Species == "virginica"] <- "red"

pairs(iris[1:4], col = cols, pch = 20)

# Now we are able to see some patterns. 

# When we provide our first argument, iris[1:4], we essentially specify which 
# columns we are interested in.
