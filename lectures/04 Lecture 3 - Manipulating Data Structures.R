# Lecture 3: Manipulating data structures
# =======================================

# 1. Removing missing data
# ------------------------

# Very often we come across data sets which are incomplete, where we miss data. 
# Let's suppose we have the following vecotr.
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5, NA)

# As we can see, some data is missing. If we would like to calculate a mean 
# value, we couldn't because R doesn't know some values.

mean(x)  # The result is NA

# To overcome this limitation we could remove NAs from the vector. Following 
# pattern is often used in this situations.

# First we create a vector denoting which elements are passing our filter.
bad <- is.na(x)

# Sencond, use "bad" vector to filter elements from x.
x <- x[!bad]

# Now we can calculate the mean value, as all elements are properly defined.
mean(x)

# The same apprach can be applied to a data frame objects.

# 2. Vectorized Operations
# ------------------------

# Say we have 2 vectors:
x <- c(1:4)
y <- c(10:13)

# We can add 2 vectors, which means that x[1] + y[1] and similarly for all other 
# indices.
x + y 

# We can apply a restriction to the vector, and it will create array of bools, 
# each denoting if restriction was met.
x > 2

# We can also perform some matrix operations. Let's create 2 matrices.
x <- matrix(1:4, 2, 2)
y <- matrix(rep(10, 4), 2, 2)  # rep is a func which repeats value in vecotor

# We can multiply matrices (element-wise). Not that useful.
x * y

# Proper matrix multiplication.
x %*% y
