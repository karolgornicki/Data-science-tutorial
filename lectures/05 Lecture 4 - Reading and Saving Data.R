# Lecture 4: Reading and saving data
# ==================================

# 1. Functions Overview
# ---------------------

# In majority of the cases we will be reading data from some external sources, 
# and use R to analyze it. We can use the following functions for reading and 
# saving (indented):
# - read.table; read.csv - for tabular data
#   - write.table
# - readLines - for reading lines from text file 
#   - writeLines 
# - source - for reading R-code 
#   - dump 
# - dget
#   - dput 
# - load - for reading in saved workspace 
#   - save 
# - unserialize - for single R object in binary form
#   - serialize 

# 2. Memory Estimation
# --------------------

# R stores all their data in the memory. So when we read data from the file, it 
# not only allocates memory and add data, but also catgorizes it. To give us a 
# better intuition let's assume we're reading a CSV which contains 1,500,000 
# rows, each containing 120 columns. For simplicity, let's just say all data is 
# numeric. The question is, how much memory is required to allocate this volume 
# of data?

# Numeric data is stored on 8 bytes, we have 120 columns, 1.5E6 rows. This gives
# us 1.44E9 bytes. 1 MB = 2^20 bytes, so it equates to 1,373 MB, which is about
# 1.34 GB.

# What's dissappointing, in order to read that volume of data, we would usually 
# require twice as much space, as R also is recognizing the type of data.

# 3. Reading text file
# --------------------

# It is a good practice to set a working directory first. When you're copying 
# path from Windows, change "\" to "/".
setwd("C:/Users/Charles/Documents/git/Data-science-tutorial/data_sample")

# Establish a connection with the text file.
con <- file("sample_text.txt")

# Read lines from the sample_text.txt
x <- readLines(con)     # read the entire file 
x <- readLines(con, 2)  # read only the first 2 lines 

# Remember to close connection after you finish reading the file. You can read
# the file first, save content in a variable(s), close the connection. 
# Afterwards, you can analyze information stored in the variable. It's a good 
# practice to close open connections as quickly as possible.
close(con)

# 4. Reading CSV file
# -------------------

train.data <- read.csv("train.csv")

# 5. Saving data
# --------------

# Save data in R format. It creates a structure code.
dput(train.data, "data.R")

# Import previously saved data.
imported.data <- dget("data.R")

# dump and source functions are used to save/read multiple objects.
