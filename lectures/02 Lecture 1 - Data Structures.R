# Lecture 1: Data types
# =====================

# In R everything is an object. Object is a ralization of a class. 
# We have following classes for data structures:
# - character (i.e. "a")
# - numeric (i.e. 3.14)
# - integer (i.e. 1L)
# - complex (i.e. 1+4i)
# - logical (i.e. TRUE)

# Some basic objects.
# - vectors (they only contains objects of the same class)
# - lists (represented as a vector, but can contain objects of differenct 
# classes)

# 1. Shortcuts 
# ------------
# In order to execute line from the scrip in the console set curson on the line 
# (or highlight multiple lines) which you want to execute, and press 
# Ctrl + Return

# In order to clear the console view press Ctrl + L

# 2. Basic entering data 
# ----------------------

# Create a variable x and assign to it (<-) value 5. Assignment can be done also 
# with (=). Traditionally (<-) was used, later on (=) was introduced to resemble 
# other programming languages, like C++.
# It is a good practice to follow Google's style guide and they advocate to use
# (<-), reference: https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml
x <- 5

# We can print value in 2 ways
x
print(x)

# Both methods produce the exact same output. In the console R prints
# [1] 5
# R prints results as sequences. In our case (x) we have only one element, and 
# the value in square bracets describes index of first element. When we will be  
# definig sequences explicitly it will make more sense. 

# 3. Creating sequences 
# ---------------------

# Let's create a sequence of numbers, from 1 to 100. Rather than writing them
# 1, 2, 3, ... we can use a shortcut
x <- 1:100

# 4. Creating vectors
# -------------------

# We can create vectors by using c function (c for concatenate).
x <- c(0.5, 0.6)      # creates a numeric vector
x <- c(T, F)          # creates a bool/logical vector
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE)   # creates a bool/logical vector
x <- c(1+4i, 2+7i)    # creates a complex vector

# We can also initalize a sort of default, or empty vector. In this instance we 
# have to explicitly specify what kind of objects we will be storing.
x <- vector("numeric", length = 10)

# Note: If we try to create a vector from the sequence of different objects, R 
# won't throw an error, but instead it will apply various castings and most 
# likely contaminate the data.

# 5. Matrices
# -----------

# We can create a matrix by using matrix function. As arguments we have to 
# supply its dimentions. nrow denotes number of rows and ncol number of columns.
m <- matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
m

# When we print the matrix we see NAs. NA stands for Not Available and it's 
# one way to describe a missing data. On this note, integers has NaN which is
# Not a Number.

# We can initalize the matrix by using:
m2 <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
m2

# As we can see, the matrix is populated by columns.

# But when we think if it, matrix is just a vector with 2 dimentions. And this 
# is how R treates them. We can create a vector and then add an attribute 
# describing dimentions to it and R will treat it as a matrix.

# Create a vector of numbers from 1 to 6.
m3 <- 1:6
# Add dimention attribute to vector. Dimention is a vector itself of length 2.
dim(m3) = c(2, 3)
m3

# We can also create matrices by binding columns, or by binding rows.
# Let's suppose we have 2 vectors.
vector.one <- c(1:3)
vector.two <- c(10:12)
# We would like to combine them together to create a matrix in which vector.one 
# constitutes the first row, and vector.two the second row. We would do it by:
m4 <- rbind(vector.one, vector.two)

# Alternatively, we can bind them as columns, vector.one will create the first 
# columns, and vector.two the second column.

m5 <- cbind(vector.one, vector.two)

# Matrices are pretty important as big chunk of statistical machine learning can 
# be reduced to inversing, transposing and multiplying matrices. Primary 
# examples are Linear Regression and Support Vector Machine.

# 6. Lists
# --------

# We can create a list by using list funciton. We can pass as many attributes 
# as we like.
sample.list <- list("a", 1, TRUE, 1+2i)
sample.list

# When we print the list we see that each element is associated with the index.
# Indices are described in double square brackets [[ ]]. We can think of lists
# as collection of vectors, where each vector contains only 1 element.

# To [ ] and [[ ]] we'll come back later when we talk about extracting subsets.

# 7. Factors
# ----------

# Factors are used to represent categorical data. If you are familiar with C++ 
# or C#, they are sort of like enums - vector of integers where each has a 
# label.

# Say we conducted a survey and people provided following answers:
survey.answers <- c("yes", "no", "no", "yes", "maybe", "yes", "yes")
survey.factors <- factor(survey.answers)

# What it does - it finds distinct values, and associates each with an integer. 
# We can accomplish the same by using table function. Additionally it will show 
# counts for each category.
table(survey.factors)
table(survey.answers)

# 8. Missing Values
# -----------------

# Previously we mentioned missing values. Basically we have:
# - NA (not available/undefined math formualtion)
# - NaN (not a number)

x <- 5
y <- NA
z <- NaN

# When we have a variable (with a single value) we can inspect whether it's NA 
# or NaN by applying these functions:
is.na(x)  # F
is.na(y)  # T
is.na(z)  # T

is.nan(x)  # F
is.nan(y)  # F
is.nan(z)  # T

# 9. Data Frames
# --------------

# Probably the most important part of the course. They are used to store tabular
# data. Think of it as collection of lists, where each list has the same length.

# We can create data frame by ourselve. I broke declaration of attributes into 
# multiple lines to make it more readable.
x <- data.frame(
  name = c("Adam", "Brian", "Celine", "Dave"),
  age = c(1:4), 
  is.friend = c(T, F, T, F))

# To view data frame as a grid call View function. Alternatively, you can click 
# on grid icon in Environment section in RStudio.
View(x)

# In order to find out about dimentions of the data frame call.
nrow(x)
ncol(x)
dim(x)

# 10. Names
# ---------

# R objects can have names. How does it work? Let's suppose we have a sequence 
# 1, 2, 3
x <- 1:3

# In order to get names associated with a sequence of elements execute this line
names(x)

# Since it didn't have any names (NULL), we can add few. Let's associate 1 with 
# "first", etc.
names(x) <- c("first", "second", "last")

# Now when we print x we see each element with its name.
x

# It can be useful to get particular element by name, rather their index. We'll 
# talk more about extacting subsets from variables in the next lecture.
x["last"]
