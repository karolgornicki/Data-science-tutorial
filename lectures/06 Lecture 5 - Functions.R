# Lecture 5: Functions
# ====================

# 1. Flow Control
# ---------------

# In R we have following flow control structures:
# - if, else 
# - for
# - while 
# - repeat (goes forever, hence use break)
# - break (exiting loop)
# - next (skips to the next iteration in the loop)
# - return (returns value)

for (i in 1:10)
  print(i)

count <- 1
while (count < 10) {
  print(count)
  count <- count + 3
}
  
# I heard that some folks find repeat as pointless function as it might be 
# non-deterministic. Well, yes, but it has its merits. For example we have a 
# learning algorithm, and we say that is has to stop when the error level goes
# below some threshold, or after 10,000 epochs. We could set repeat, maintain a
# counter and if erorr.rate goes below our level, or counter > 10,000 then exit
# our repeat block.

# 2. Sample functions
# -------------------

# Simple function adding 2 numbers. Notice that the last line is a returned 
# value.
add.two.numbers <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}

add.two.numbers(2, 3)

# Simple function filtering odd numbers. %% is modulo division.
# This is a commonly used pattern. First create a vector which specifies which 
# elements (denoted by their indices) pass your filter. Next filter your 
# original data using this vector.
filter.odd.numbers <- function(data) {
  use <- data %% 2 == 0
  data[use]
}

filter.odd.numbers(1:20)
