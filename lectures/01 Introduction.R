# Abstract
# --------

# The aim of this tutorial is to walk you through some basics of R and provide
# an accelerated introduction to data science with main focus on machine 
# learning. 

# The material is organized in a series of lectures. Each lecture contains 
# comments explaining all commands, and concepts. In theory everyone should be 
# able to follow along the material without any external help.

# After completion of the tutorial you should be comfortable working with R and 
# RStudio, be able to write your own scripts analysing some data, and create 
# simple prediction models preceded by some data mining/cleaning activities.

# Content
# -------

# The material is organized in a series of lectures:

# Lecture  1: Introduces all data structures used in R.
# Lecture  2: Demonstrates how we can extract information from data structures.
# Lecture  3: Shows how we can augment the content of our data structures.
# Lecture  4: Presents how we can save and read data from and to files.
# Lecture  5: Introduces the notion of a function, and explains how to write 
#             your own functions.
# Lecture  6: This is an optional lecture. It talks about internal mechanics of  
#             R, how variables are stored, and their scope.
# Lecture  7: Shows how we can explore data sets in order to find relevant 
#             information - using statistical methods, but also charts.
# Lecture  8: It's more practical session. It showcases how we can build a 
#             simple (naive) prediction model.
# Lecture  9: Provides theoretical introduction to machine learning.
# Lecture 10: Demonstrates how to use different packages in order to build 
#             simple prediction models.
# Lecture 11: Demonstrates how to conduct analysis of real data set in order to 
#             create prediction model.
