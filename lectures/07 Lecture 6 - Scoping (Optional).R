# Lecture 6: Scoping (theory)
# ===========================

# When you first learning about R this topic isn't crucial to understand, 
# however in a long run it will definitely save you some time while debugging.

# 1. How does R store variables?
# ------------------------------

# Previously we saw this line
x <- 5

# What we do here, we define a variable "x" and assign value "5" to it. If you 
# are reading this in RStudio, in the Environment section you can see that in 
# Values section "x" and "5" showed up.

# R takes a very simplistic apprach to variables, and store them as pairs:
# - name (e.g. x)
# - value (e.g. 5)

# If you are familiar with other programming languages you can think that R is 
# maintaining a symbol tabel (e.g. hashtable) tied with the environment.

# When we type in console something like this
x + 3

# It will print the result of this opetation, which is 8. But what exactly R is 
# doing here? R inspects variables in the Enviroment, looking for name "x," and 
# when it finds it, R uses its value and adds to 3.

# 2. How does R find values for variables?
# ----------------------------------------

# OK, so what's going to when we run this line?
x <- c(1, 2)

# As we remember from previous lectures, it creates a vector containing 2 
# elements: 1 and 2. But from R perspective, R reads this line from right to 
# left. When it gets to "c" it looks in the Environment for name "c". R doesn't
# know it's a function - as far as R is concerned it's some variable (notice, 
# variables can store values like numbers, but also functions - we'll talk about 
# that later.) We didn't declare "c", and in the Environment tab in RStudio you 
# can see variables stored in the Environment - there's no "c" there.

# Let's spend a few moments to talk about environments in general. Environment 
# like a namespace, is a space in which you can define various names (variables) 
# and attach values to them. But it would be unthinkable to ask user to define 
# everything. R comes forward, and allows user to import packages - it's like 
# appending additional environments to our own environment. 

# Moreover, every environemnt has a parent environment - the environment where 
# it was created (sort of).

# Going back to our example. R inspects "c" - doesn't know what it is, so it 
# looks for "c" in the enviroment. If it fails to find a match, it loops through 
# all packages that are added to our environment (additional environments). In 
# this case it finds "c" in base package ("base" is the name of the package), 
# and applies corresponding to it value. In this instance, it's a function. 

# Hypothetically, if our name "c" wouldn't be find in any packages, R would 
# navigate to parent environment, which in this case would be "Empty 
# Environment" (which doesn't have parent). Empty environment doesn't have 
# anything, so it would fail to find a match and print an error message in 
# console.

# In order to find out which environments and packages are being searched call.
search()

# R will look for the first match, so in theory, you could alter the order in 
# this list. I don't know how to do it, but I'm sure Google could help you with 
# that. 

# 3. What does lexical scoping mean?
# ----------------------------------

# If you are familiar with languages like C++, or C#, this might be a bit 
# counter-intuitive for you. R uses lexical scoping (lexical scoping is used in 
# Scheme (dialect of LISP), but also in Clojure for "let" command, binding uses 
# dynamic scoping). I think Python also allows lexical clojures, but I would 
# have to check that out.

# So, what the lexical scoping is all about? Let's say we have a function which 
# takes a value (maybe number of steps) as an argument and calculates the 
# overall distance. Inside this function we set the value of variable unit, and 
# call a function which does the actual calculation. The code looks like that.
unit <- 10

get.distance <- function(steps) {
  unit <- 5
  calculate.distance(steps)
}

calculate.distance <- function(s) {
  s * unit
}

# Execute the following line - what's the distance of 10 steps? 
get.distance(10)

# The result is 100. When R get to the point where it executes 
# "calculate.distance" it encounters "unit" variable. At first it looks in its 
# local environment, which is within this function. "unit" is not declared there
# to it goes it its parent environment. But parent environment is not the 
# function in which the function was called, but in which it was declared. In 
# this instance, it is Global Environment. This is the key feature of lexical 
# scope - it binds things where they were defined, not where they are called 
# (this is called dynamic scoping.) That's why unit gets value 10.

# If your plan was to override the default value of "unit" with 5 and use it to 
# calculate the final distance you can apply 2 strategies.

# Strategy 1 - pass unit as an argument to "calculate.distance" function.
unit <- 10

get.distance <- function(steps) {
  unit <- 5
  calculate.distance(steps, unit)
}

calculate.distance <- function(s, u) {
  s * u
}

get.distance(10)

# Strategy 2 - declare function "calculate.distance" within "get.distance"
unit <- 10

get.distance <- function(steps) {
  unit <- 5
  calculate.distance <- function(s) {
    s * unit
  }
  calculate.distance(steps)
}

get.distance(10)

# On a side note - each function should be responsible for doing one, and only 
# one thing, and is respect to that the above desing is not good. It was created
# purely to make the point, and demonstrate how scoping works.

# 4. Practical application of lexical scoping
# -------------------------------------------

# Exaples provided in the above section may seem to be detached from the reality 
# to some, so I though I can give you a better example which showcase this 
# feature.

# Let's say that in our code we're doing a lot of raising to the power x. In 
# some cases we raise to the power 2, in the next iteration to the power 3, etc.
# We could create the following function which will save the power value and 
# return another function which accepts the number we want to apply power 
# operation to.
raise.to.power <- function (p) {
  function (n) {
    n ^ p
  }
}

# At this point you can see, that inner function (the one which is returned) 
# "remembers" the value p which was used when it was created, and uses it 
# whenever new function is called. 

# By calling this function we get back another function which already know, that 
# whatever argument we will supply, will be raised to the power of 3.
to.the.power.3 <- raise.to.power(3)

# Now we can simply call this function (stored in variable) with argument 4, and 
# it will raise 4 to 3, 4^3 = 64.
to.the.power.3(4) 

# Alternatively, you could do it in one line, but most of the time, you would 
# write those function with re-usability in mind.
raise.to.power(3)(4)
