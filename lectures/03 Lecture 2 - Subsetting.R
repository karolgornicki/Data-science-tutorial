# Lecture 2: Subsetting
# =====================

# 1. Subsetting
# -------------

# Let's suppose we have a vector of few charactes.
chars <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")

# And we would like to extract only some data from it - we are not interested in 
# the entire collection. For that we will use 3 techniqies:
# - [ ] - always returns object of the same class as the original
# - [[ ]] - extracts single element from a list or a data frame
# - $ - extracts single element from a list or a data frame 

# We can return single element. Notice that sequence is indexes starting with 1.
chars[1]

# When you prefix the element with the minus sign it will return the entire 
# vector except for the element you mentioned. So below will return all items, 
# except for the second.
chars[-2]

# We can return a range.
chars[2:4]

# The minus rule also applies to ranges.
chars[-(2:4)]
chars[-seq(2, 4)]  # seq function generates sequence of numbers, from-to

# We can also filter elements.
chars[chars > "b"]

# The last one requires a bit more explanation. Let's examine what inner clause 
# do. It maps each element of the sequence of boolean values, whether they meet
# our restriction or not.
chars > "b"

# Next we pass this sequence (of TRUE/FALSE elements) as a restriction to chars
# and R only prints those which are TRUE.

# In order to extract data from matrix we would do the following.
m <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)

# Get single element.
m[1, 2]

# Get row.
m[1,]

# Get column.
m[,2]

# Let's now crate a list.
sample.list <- list(foo = 1:5, bar = 12.3)

# We can extract the first element from the list in 2 ways.

# We see that it shows first element's name - $foo, and also all its elements. 
# That's because is a list. [] returns object of the same class as original.
sample.list[1]

# This returns a vector that is sitting on the first index. As this is a vector,
# it doesn't have a name. Name was associated with a list.
sample.list[[1]]

# We can also extract value associated with the name. Few alternatives:
sample.list$foo
sample.list["foo"]
sample.list[["foo"]]

# 2. Partial matching
# -------------------

# It is possible to provide just part of the name and R will figure out which 
# name it relates to and provide the data.
sample.list$f
sample.list[["f"]]  # NULL
sample.list[["f", exact = FALSE]]  # returns data
