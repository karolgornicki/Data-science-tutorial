# Lecture 8: Creative Naive Predictions
# =====================================

# 1. Task
# -------

# The task is to create some naive prediction model guessing whether passengers 
# of Titanic survived or perished. You should, without problems, achieve 70% 
# with your model (it's really easy.)

# At this point we don't have to be concerned about validation techniques. We 
# will do it properly when we get to machine learning.

# Below I present 2 candidate solutions.

# 2. Solution #1 (78.68%)
# -----------------------

# Load the data.
setwd("C:/Users/Charles/Documents/git/Data-science-tutorial/data_sample")
train <- read.csv("train.csv")

# We know that women and children took precedence during the  rescue procedure.
# Let's inspect women first. Our data contains sex.

# This shows count of each sex.
table(train$Sex)

# Now let's see how many individuals survived in each group.
table(train$Sex, train$Survived)

# And as proportions.
prop.table(table(train$Sex, train$Survived))

# To see relative proportions (per row), add 1 as second argument.
prop.table(table(train$Sex, train$Survived), 1)

# We can see that 74% females survived, whereas only 19% males.
# We can create a dummy model, predicting that all women survived, and all men 
# perished.

# To do that we create a new column in our data frame, prediction.
# By default everyone died.
train$Prediction <- 0

# Update Preduction column, if female then set as survived (=1)
train$Prediction[train$Sex == 'female'] <- 1

# Let's check how accurate we are.
train$AssessPrediction <- 0
train$AssessPrediction[train$Prediction == 1 & train$Survived == 1] <- 1
train$AssessPrediction[train$Prediction == 0 & train$Survived == 0] <- 1
prop.table(table(train$AssessPrediction))

# 3. Solutions #2 (80.8%)
# -----------------------

# Load data.
setwd("C:/Users/Charles/Documents/git/Data-science-tutorial/data_sample")
train <- read.csv("train.csv")

# We developed our first model. We used one variable, sex, and assumed that 
# all women will survive whereas all men were going to perish.

# In this example let's try to raise the level of complexity by incorporating 
# move variables.

# Let's categorize price of tickets.
train$fare.categroy <- '30+'
train$fare.categroy[train$Fare < 30 & train$Fare >= 20] <- '20-30'
train$fare.categroy[train$Fare < 20 & train$Fare >= 10] <- '10-20'
train$fare.categroy[train$Fare < 10] <- '<10'

# Let's have a look whether there's a correlation between the amount people paid
# for their tickets, class of a cabin and their sex.
aggregate(Survived ~ fare.categroy + Pclass + Sex, 
          data = train, 
          FUN = function(x) {sum(x)/length(x)})

# We could observe that female in 3rd class who paid 20 or more were unlikely to 
# survive. 
train$Prediction2 <- 0
train$Prediction2[train$Sex == 'female'] <- 1
train$Prediction2[train$Sex == 'female' & train$Pclass == 3 & train$Fare >= 20] <- 0

train$AssessPrediction2 <- 0
train$AssessPrediction2[train$Prediction2 == 1 & train$Survived == 1] <- 1
train$AssessPrediction2[train$Prediction2 == 0 & train$Survived == 0] <- 1
prop.table(table(train$AssessPrediction2))
