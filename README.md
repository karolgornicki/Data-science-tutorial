# Data-science-tutorial

The aim of this tutorial is to walk you through some basics of R and provide an accelerated introduction to data science with main focus on machine learning. 

The material is organized in a series of lectures. Each lecture contains comments explaining all commands, and concepts. In theory everyone should be able to follow along the material without any external help.

After completion of the tutorial you should be comfortable working with R and RStudio, be able to write your own scripts analysing some data, and create simple prediction models preceded by some data mining/cleaning activities.
